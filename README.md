## Library Management System Proposal 

This is a library management system application that is responsible for managing the librariesâ€™ borrowing system online.
Users can see the books available, borrow books, return them. They can also search for their desired books by genre and 
see details about the book they are getting online including author, name and genre. The administrators will be given access
to the user accounts and have the option to create a user account for a customer, deleting accounts, and adding or 
updating data in the system. To keep everything organized, managers can keep a secure record online that tracks where 
the books are. Public libraries that want to operate online and have the option of lending out books will be the main
users of this application.

This project is of interest to me since I am a bookworm myself and really enjoy reading books and seeing reviews. I would 
love the option to conduct a book search online and view the options a library has to offer without physically visiting it. 
I believe this would be way more efficient and save a lot of time for both customers and managers.  Additionally, it is 
also an excellent way to monitor books, lower the risk of error and reduce the chance of losing paper-based documents. 
Moreover, it makes the whole process of getting the books more accessible and available to a wider variety of people.
