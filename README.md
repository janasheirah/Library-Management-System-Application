## Library Management System Proposal 
This is a library management system application that is responsible for managing the librariesâ€™ borrowing system online.
Users can create accounts, borrow books, return them and view the due dates for doing so. They can also search for their 
desired books by genre or author and see details about the book they are getting online including author, rating and genre.
The administrators will be given access to the user accounts and have the option to create a user account for a customer, 
deleting accounts, and adding or updating data in the system. They can also send messages to users about books and automatically
send reminders when the deadline for returning a book is approaching. To keep everything organized, managers can keep a secure
record online that tracks where the books are. Public libraries that want to operate online and have the option of lending out 
books will be the main users of this application.

This project is of interest to me since I am a bookworm myself and really enjoy reading books and seeing reviews. I would 
love the option to conduct a book search online and view the options a library has to offer without physically visiting it. 
I believe this would be way more efficient and save a lot of time for both customers and managers.  Additionally, it is 
also an excellent way to monitor books, lower the risk of error and reduce the chance of losing paper-based documents. 
Moreover, it makes the whole process of getting the books more accessible and available to a wider variety of people.
